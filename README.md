# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Oftentimes in programming, we will want to sort values of collections based on
certain criteria. We might need to sort a list of numbers, before we apply a
specific set of instructions onto it. In such a case, we would write one line of
pseudocode, which indicates that we are sorting the list. 

# But what would the runtime complexity of this line be?
Well, it depends on the algorithm we use to do it. When we talk about the
runtime complexity of algorithms in a mathematical context, we will almost
always use the so-called Big-O notation.
